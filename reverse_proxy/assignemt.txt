== Task 4
Create a Dockerfile basing on Nginx image
Configure Nginx to serve as a reverse proxy to other services (you'll have to modify nginx.conf)
Add two other services inside a docker-compose file (Jenkins, Nexus, Matomo, Wordpress, Joomla - your choice)
Configure only the Nginx port to be externally accessible, and other services to only be available via Nginx proxy
Make sure that everything works
